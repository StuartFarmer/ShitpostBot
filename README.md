# shitpostbot

Does shit in discord servers.

For now it:

1. Replies 'lmao' whenever anyone says 'ayy'. Hilarious, I know.

2. Detects faces in images and crops in on them. Is actually funny.

## Usage

1. Put your discord API key into a file called `API_KEY`
2. Run bot.js

If you have issues installing OpenCV to get this shit to work that's not my problem.

Also package.json doesn't have all the dependencies in it. Oops.
